# QAP 2 - Java

## What This Is
Four Java problems focusing on object composition and aggregation. Built a CreditCard system, classes, and a CampusMap that puts it all together.

## The Problems

**Problem 1 - CreditCard System**
Address → Person → Money → CreditCard. Each class builds on the last. Learned copy constructors here to keep data safe.

**Problem 2 - MyPoint & MyLine**
Points with x,y coordinates. Lines connect two points. Distance formula stuff.

**Problem 3 - MyRectangle**
Two points make a rectangle. Calculate area, perimeter, etc.

**Problem 4 - CampusMap**
The big one. Buildings are rectangles, walkways are lines, fountains are circles. Add them to a map, calculate totals.

## Running It
```
java Problem1.CreditCardDemo
java Problem2.MyLineTest
java Problem3.MyRectangleTest
java Problem4.CampusMapTest
```

## Hours
- Problem 1: ~3 hrs (hardest, most new concepts)
- Problem 2: ~1 hr
- Problem 3: ~30 min
- Problem 4: ~1.5 hrs
- **Total: around 6 hours**

- Class notes

## Thoughts
Problem 1 was rough — lots of moving parts. 
By Problem 3 I had the pattern down and it went faster. 
Problem 4 was just combining everything which made sense once the pieces were built.
